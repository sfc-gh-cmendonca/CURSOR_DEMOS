# JPMC Markets AI Demo - Setup Guide
*Demo Scenarios 1 & 2 for Equity Research Analysts*

## üéâ **Demo Successfully Deployed!** ‚úÖ

This demo includes:
- **2 Semantic Views** for Cortex Analyst (earnings analysis & thematic research) 
- **2 Cortex Search Services** for document search (transcripts & reports)
- **7 Tech Companies** with realistic sample data (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, META, SNOW)
- **Dual-Tool Agents** combining structured data analysis + unstructured content search

## üéØ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Snowflake Connection
Ensure your `connections.toml` file is properly configured at one of these locations:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/snowflake/connections.toml`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/snowflake/connections.toml`  
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\snowflake\connections.toml`

Example `connections.toml` content:
```toml
[default]
account = "your_account_identifier"
user = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
warehouse = "COMPUTE_WH"
database = "MARKETS_AI_DEMO"
schema = "RAW_DATA"
role = "SYSADMIN"
```

### 3. Deploy the Enhanced Dual-Tool Demo
```bash
python deploy_dual_tool_demo.py
```

‚úÖ **This creates**:
- **2 Semantic Views** in `MARKETS_AI_DEMO.ANALYTICS` schema
- **2 Cortex Search Services** for document search
- **Sample data** for 7 tech companies (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, META, SNOW)

### 4. Configure Sophisticated Dual-Tool Agents
1. Log into Snowflake Intelligence UI
2. **Follow the comprehensive guide**: `DUAL_TOOL_AGENT_SETUP.md`
3. **Create two sophisticated agents**:
   - `Tech Earnings Analysis Assistant` (Cortex Analyst + Cortex Search)
   - `Tech Thematic Research Assistant` (Cortex Analyst + Cortex Search)
4. **Test both agents** with the enhanced dual-tool questions

### 5. Run the Enhanced Demo
Follow the advanced scripts in `DUAL_TOOL_DEMO_SCRIPTS.md`

### 6. Cleanup (Optional)
When you're done with the demo, you can clean up all objects:

```bash
# Complete cleanup - removes everything
python cleanup_demo.py complete

# Partial cleanup - keeps database structure
python cleanup_demo.py partial

# Data only cleanup - clears table data only
python cleanup_demo.py data_only
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Cleanup actions cannot be undone!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚úÖ Deployment Successful**: The semantic views and search services are working correctly!

**Agent configuration issues**:
- Ensure you're using the correct database: `MARKETS_AI_DEMO`
- Verify schema: `ANALYTICS` for semantic views
- Check ID/Title columns are set correctly for Cortex Search tools

**Agent not responding to queries**:
- Test semantic views: Use simple questions like "Show me Apple's latest earnings"
- Test search services: Use queries like "What did management say about AI strategy?"
- Verify both Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search tools are configured

**Performance optimization**:
- Use warehouse size M or L for better performance
- Search services may take 5-10 minutes to fully index after deployment
- Complex queries combining both tools may take longer initially

### Support Resources
- **Agent Setup Guide**: `DUAL_TOOL_AGENT_SETUP.md`
- **Demo Scripts**: `DUAL_TOOL_DEMO_SCRIPTS.md`
- **Cleanup Tool**: `cleanup_demo.py` (3 cleanup levels available)

---

## üßπ Cleanup Options

The `cleanup_demo.py` script provides three levels of cleanup:

### Complete Cleanup (`python cleanup_demo.py complete`)
- ‚úÖ Removes ENTIRE `MARKETS_AI_DEMO` database
- ‚úÖ Removes all schemas, tables, views, and search services  
- ‚úÖ Perfect for completely resetting after demo
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This cannot be undone!

### Partial Cleanup (`python cleanup_demo.py partial`) 
- ‚úÖ Removes all data and objects
- ‚úÖ Keeps database and schema structure
- ‚úÖ Good for keeping structure while clearing content

### Data Only Cleanup (`python cleanup_demo.py data_only`)
- ‚úÖ Truncates all table data
- ‚úÖ Keeps all objects, views, and services intact
- ‚úÖ Perfect for reloading fresh demo data

### Cleanup Troubleshooting
- If cleanup fails, you can manually drop objects in Snowflake UI
- Run cleanup with different levels if complete cleanup fails
- Check object dependencies if individual drops fail
