## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How current is the data?"**
A: "The demo uses synthetic data with dynamic dates that update relative to the current quarter. In production, this would connect to real-time market data feeds and research databases."

**Q: "Can this handle other sectors besides technology?"**
A: "Absolutely. The same framework applies to any sector - we just need to load the relevant company data and research reports. The AI models understand financial concepts across industries."

**Q: "What about data security and compliance?"**
A: "Snowflake provides enterprise-grade security with role-based access control, data encryption, and audit logging. All data stays within your Snowflake environment."

**Q: "How does this integrate with existing research workflows?"**
A: "The agents can be embedded into existing tools via APIs, or accessed through Snowflake Intelligence UI. They complement rather than replace existing research processes."

**Q: "What's the implementation timeline?"**
A: "Basic setup takes days, not months. The main effort is data integration and training agents on your specific research processes."

### Demo Troubleshooting

**If agent doesn't respond quickly**:
- "While we wait, let me highlight that this is processing complex financial calculations in real-time..."
- Have backup screenshots ready

**If specific data points are questioned**:
- "This is synthetic demo data designed to show capabilities. In production, this would be your actual market data feeds."
