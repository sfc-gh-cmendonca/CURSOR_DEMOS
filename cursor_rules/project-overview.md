## Architecture Principles

### Dual-Tool AI Architecture
Each demonstration agent combines two complementary AI capabilities:

```
Business Query → Snowflake Intelligence Agent
                 ├── Cortex Analyst Tool (Structured Data)
                 └── Cortex Search Tool (Unstructured Content)
                 └── Unified Response
```

**Benefits of Dual-Tool Approach**:
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Quantitative metrics + qualitative insights
- **Single Interface**: Business users get complete answers in one query
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized response patterns across different data types
- **Scalable Architecture**: Same pattern works across industries and use cases

### Data Architecture Strategy
- **Raw Data Layer**: Source tables with realistic business data
- **Analytics Layer**: Semantic views for business-friendly data access
- **Search Layer**: Indexed unstructured content for semantic search
- **Agent Layer**: AI tools configured to access appropriate data sources

### Security and Governance
- **Role-Based Access**: Leverage Snowflake's native RBAC system
- **Data Governance**: All data remains within Snowflake boundary
- **Audit Trail**: Track all queries and responses for compliance
- **Privacy Protection**: Synthetic data only, no customer information
